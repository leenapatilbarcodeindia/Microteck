SRS: What is given in the system

User manual: How the system works


pcb
cheche
transformer


RM warehouse ope: similar process as other
only receiving based on GRM
manu date may/may not required

quality check: picking sample material:
2 scenarios: 1 withput quality will not receive the material
2. pass it or fail

Putaway: material location, material matrix

3 sivalik, balaji, 

picklist generation: kit banake production team ko bhejna (finalization pending)

picking and issuarance are common

shop floor return: 1 time label print after receiving, 

Rework: Multiple places cooprated, In the RM we got material and needs rework, so need to pass and fail. (Hold)

Stencil inventory: solder paste, hardware componant, it has risky lifecycle, inventory maintenace of the asset, 

Transformer: laser marking se barcode generate hoga, serial number humari system se generate hoga, identification of transformer, 
transformer label pritning
putaway: in trolly

WIP/SHop flooer operations: MIS process, 1st laser marking barcode print >and serial number> offline process> then loader >solder pasting> picking >inspection

Reflow oven: humara application nahi hai

AOI: 
X ray machine: need to confirm

Rounting: most critical componant in this project: Mapping


Manual insertion: component kahape lagane hai

Circuit testing(ICT): automated testing machine: humara barcode leke jayenge and data capture karenge

Fuction test (FCT) automated process isme pass or fail note karna hai

Performance testing: if the output is proper or not

Chassis label printing: cabin label printing, we add labels on this

Chassis transformern mapping: trial mapping> connection setup. chasis barcode helps to capture the details

Assembly: same 

Packing: 3 stckers

Warehue operation
